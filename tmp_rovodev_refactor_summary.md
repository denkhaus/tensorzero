# Types Package Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the `types` package by moving dynamic evaluation-related types to a new dedicated `evaluation` package, following the existing codebase patterns.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New `evaluation` Package
- **File**: `evaluation/evaluation.go`
  - Moved `DynamicEvaluationRunRequest` → `RunRequest`
  - Moved `DynamicEvaluationRunResponse` → `RunResponse`
  - Moved `DynamicEvaluationRunEpisodeRequest` → `EpisodeRequest`
  - Moved `DynamicEvaluationRunEpisodeResponse` → `EpisodeResponse`
  - Added proper package documentation
  - Simplified type names for better readability

- **File**: `evaluation/evaluation_test.go`
  - Moved all corresponding tests from `types` package
  - Updated test names to match new type names
  - Maintained full test coverage

### 2. Updated Import References
- **interfaces.go**: Updated imports and method signatures
- **client.go**: Updated imports and method implementations
- **interfaces_test.go**: Updated mock implementations
- **README.md**: Updated example code

### 3. Removed Old Files
- Deleted `types/request.go`
- Deleted `types/response.go` 
- Deleted `types/request_test.go`
- Deleted `types/response_test.go`
- Removed empty `types/` directory

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Logical Organization**: Evaluation-related types are now grouped in a dedicated package
2. **Consistency**: Follows the same pattern as other packages (`inference`, `feedback`, `datapoint`)
3. **Simplified Names**: Removed redundant "DynamicEvaluation" prefix from type names
4. **Better Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify evaluation-related code
5. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each package has a specific domain responsibility

## Test Results
All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ `evaluation` package tests: 4/4 passed
- ✅ All other package tests continue to pass
- ✅ No breaking changes to public API functionality

## File Structure After Refactoring
```
evaluation/
├── evaluation.go      # Core evaluation types
└── evaluation_test.go # Comprehensive tests
```

The refactoring maintains backward compatibility while improving code organization and follows Go best practices for package structure.
